## Config

The key-value configuration supports any properties, including hierarchies through `key1/key2`. However, there are
a few default values included that should be checked by the language.

Config values should not be set in a language, so during language initialization the config is considered read-only.
The lifetime of the config is undefined after the exit of the initialization function, so values need to be copied if necessary.

### Memory/Acquire

String containing a pointer to a function in the format `void* (size_t byteCount)`.

### Memory/Release

String containing a pointer to a function in the format `void (void* pointer)`.

### Parsing/UnsupportedBehavior

String containing a value to specify the processing behavior for unsupported nodes.

- `0` or `throw` to generate a runtime-dependent error and terminate the parsing process.
- `1` or `pass` to pass unsupported nodes, but parse everything else, including their children. May break the syntax.
- `2` or `skip` to pass unsupported nodes and children. Should keep the syntax correct unless it's an important node.
