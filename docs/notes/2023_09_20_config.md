## Config

The key-value configuration supports any properties, including hierarchies through `key1/key2`. However, there are
a few default values included that should be checked by the language.

Config values should not be set in a language, so during language initialization the config is considered read-only.
The lifetime of the config is undefined after the exit of the initialization function, so values need to be copied if necessary.

### Memory/Acquire

### Parsing/ProcessUnsupported

String containing `true` or `false`. Whether unsupported nodes and (optionally) their children should be parsed without a payload.
