## High-level API

This API is in pseudo-code and some parts will be replaced. For example, data types.

### Message

> Replacement for the logging API from before.

Can be used for logging, but also includes error messages
to replace exceptions since they aren't supported in C.

```ts
interface IMessage {
    code: number; // or string? meant to specify info/warning/error
    text: string; // actual text or UNIQUE_I18N_KEY
}
```

### Result

> Replacement for the result API from before.

If any data is returned, the type is documented in the source.
Replaces exceptions/errors in environments that don't support them.

```ts
interface IResult {
    code: number; // either custom return code, posix/win32 code, or http code
    data: any;
    messages: IMessage[];
    messageCount: number;
}
```

### Node

> Replacement for the node API from before.

The actual content is specified in the payload.
The responsible visitor is determined through payloadType.

```ts
interface INode {
    payload: any;
    payloadType: string;
    parent: INode;
    children: INode[];
    childCount: number;
}
```

### Resource

> Replacement for the text/binary input/output API from before.

Text or binary can be easily specified through MIME-type.

```ts
interface IResource {
    content: byte[];
    contentSize: number; // size in bytes
    contentType: string;
}
```

### Config

> Replacement for the configuration API from before.

Just a simple key-value config storage,
hierarchial keys may be supported using e.g. key1/key2/key3.

```ts
interface IConfig {
    getString(key: string): string;
    setString(key: string, value: string): IResult;
}
```

### Language

> Replacement for the input/output language API from before.

Holds context for current pass,
may be reused but can be transient and re-init every time.

```ts
interface ILanguage {
    init(config: IConfig): IResult;
    loadTree(resource: IResource): IResult<INode>; // INode in data
    storeTree(node: INode): IResult<IResource>; // IResource in data
}
```
