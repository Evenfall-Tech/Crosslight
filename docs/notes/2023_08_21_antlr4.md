## ANTLR4 Notes

By default, ANTLR4 creates 2 channels: `DEFAULT_TOKEN_CHANNEL=0` and `HIDDEN=1`.
Further channels are added in the order of appearance and have consecutive indices.

The inheritance for tokens is `CommonToken -> WriteableToken -> Token` and only
`CommonToken` accepts a `Recognizer` for prettier `toString`.
