## Crosslight rules

A set of rules the Crosslight project follows on top of node-specific rules. The rules for individual nodes can be found in their description.
The rules should be enforced by an additional optional formal verification language.

1. There should only be one `source_root` at the top of a node hierarchy. If additional instances are found in the tree, the processing terminates.
2. If the only child of a `scope` is another instance of it, they should be merged into one.
3. If `source_root` contains only one `scope` instance, it should be promoted to be global.
