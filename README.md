## About

Crosslight is developed as a plugin-based translation / interpretation environment. The initial goal of this repository was to translate C# code into C++ to use in time-dependent applications (with hopes of speeding up the runtime).

### Projects

Under the umbrella of Crosslight, a few linked projects are developed:
- API for libraries that translate input and output languages.
- Common for code that is used by all featured executables (GUI and CLI).
- CIL for Common Intermediate Language translation.
- Viewer for an Avalonia-based GUI system to view and edit notes.

## Installation and Usage

Currently the solution is built using .Net Core 3.1 / .Net Standard 2.0 with Visual Studio 2019. Further details on the building process will be added in the future.
